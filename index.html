    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>2-3 large eggs</li>
      <li>Salt, to taste</li>
      <li>Pepper, to taste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon of butter or oil</li>
      <li>Optional fillings: cheese, diced vegetables, cooked meats, herbs</li>
    </ol>






    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Beat the eggs: In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed.
        You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.
      </li>

      <li>
        Heat the pan: Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.
      </li>

      <li>
        Cook the omelette: Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure
        the eggs evenly coat the surface.
      </li>

      <li>
        Add fillings (optional): When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the
        middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.
      </li>

      <li>
        Fold and serve: As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the
        fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.
      </li>

      <li>
        Enjoy: Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.
      </li>
    </ol>
